## VDC Control Panel

The VDC Control Panel provides a web panel to manage a virtual datacenter.

The panel includes a 'technical tutorial' for end users. The content of this technical tutorial can be changed by editing the files in https://github.com/0-complexity/openvcloud_fe/tree/master/Portal/Docs.

Third party developers can integrate the VDC Control Panel into their website as documented [here](vdc_control_panel.md).
